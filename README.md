#Hello Hello! 

So I've put together some options for flights + villas.   

### What about Florence? 

It's not really a beach holiday but the area is amazing. We could visit Pisa, Florence and the rest of Tuscany from here. 

Ryanair fly directly to Pisa:

And there are some awesome Villa's available around the area.

### Barcelona 

Ryanair fly direct from Glasgow Prestwick.

The cheapest seems to be from Sunday 31st July to 7th Aug at around 140:

Some nice Villas around Barcelona.
Think it would be cool to chill outside and we can take a few day trips into Barcelona itself:

###Mallorca
  
Flights are around the same price as Barcelona but Villas seem to be much nicer.
